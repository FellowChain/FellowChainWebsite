      <h3>Risk Management Tools</h3>
      <p> Fellows Token will be used as utility token and will allow to pay for following operations:
        <ol>
          <li>Creation of new Insurance Cooperative</li>
          <li>To pay for financial products of Fellows Network (like reinsurance)</li>
          <li>Use of Fellows Tools on monthly basis, proportionally to number of users</li>
          <li> eventually as a mean of payment for premiums (denominated in fiat currency)</li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p> Earnings will be used for following purposes:
        <ol>
          <li>To pay external parties for stabilisation of FST/USD exchange rate</li>
          <li>To decrease total supply by burning the tokens (to encourage saving it)</li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>It is important to note, that burning FST will inevitably lead to deflatory nature of token
      and therefore it will become great store of value, which is very desired property for insurance premiums</p>
