      <h3>Stability Features</h3>
      <h4>Conflict of interests</h4>
      <p>
        Conflict of interests is very important concept in insurance companies. While in most industries companies stockholders interest is
        aligned with providing good service to its customers in insurance industry it is not allways a case. Profit of insurance company
        comes charging premiums higher the payouts. Therefore profitability of its business strictly depends on how many claim it will be
        able to reject and how big premiums it will be able to market as fair. <b> And that is great space for mutuals, </b>mutuals works differently
        they are co-owned by their customers. Therefore there is no customer-owner conflict. That extraordinary. It is hard to bring another
        such example in economics.
      </p>
      <p> But it is not all that perfect. Because usually average (measured by amount of shares) mutuals owner is less aware of its rights than
        average stock owner manager-owner conflict kicks in. Information assymetry beetwen managers and mutuals owners usuall makes problem even worse.
        Thats <b>perfect case for blockchain</b> with natural <b>transparency</b> and <b>immutability</b>
        of blockchain Fellows Network can build tools helping mutuals owners to supervisor managers. With <b>automated execution</b> can easily
        build <b>votings</b> and <b>veto</b> functionality.</p>
    <h4>Insufficent capital</h4>
     <p>While stock insurance companies has obvious disadvantages they have also some not so obvious benefits. Stock owned company in case of lack of funds
       (which in insurance industry happends quite often due tu stochastic nature of an industry) gain new capital by issuing new stocks in expense of former shareholders.
        In order to create competetive advantage to mutual insurers Fellows Network will provide Blockchain based solutions that will help to posses capital to mutual insurers.
      Namely cooperative owners can volountary borrow money to insurance company in return for a discount in future premiums. Then insurance company can roll debt over year after a year among new
      (or repeated) insurance participants. <b>All trustless</b> due to automatic blockchain execution.</p>
      <p> Moreover with blockchain <b>transparency</b> and immutability
      it is possible to provide market for blockchain securities (coinsurance offers trading, financial guaranties trading etc.). Blockchain for obvious reassons is
      great tool to tokenize risk and make it easily tradable. Another tools commonly used by mutual insurance companies is CDS (Common Default Swaps) trading in order to manage levels of risk exposure,
      which due to <b>inherent</b> blockchain <b>immutability, transparency</b> and  <b>unconditional execution</b> is another perfect usecase for <b>blockchain</b>.
