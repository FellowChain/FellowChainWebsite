      <p>There is many projects in Ethereum space. Literally thousents, so what makes our project extraordinary?</p>
      <p>Several things actually:</p>
      <ol>
        <li> You can earn FLS Tokens not only by sending us money (POA to be precise), but also by contribution to a project.
        This aclually is easiest way to gain FLS.</li>
        <li>Tokens are usable from day 1. You can Use them to gain voting power in further project decision (See Governance).</li>
        <li>We do not want compete with current insurance industry we will ally with huge part of it (mutuals insurers to be precise - See Why Mutuals needs blockchain).</li>
        <li>We will provide tools for mutual insurers that will increase their effectivness. We do not intend to build our own insurance company.</li>
        <li>Usage of all tools will require spending of FLS which once used will be in great part removed from token supply (burned). What makes it perfect store of value</li>
