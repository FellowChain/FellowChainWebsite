      <h3>Why Mutuals need blockchain</h3>
      <h4>Conflict of interests</h4>
      <p>
        Conflict of interests is very important concept in insurance companies. While in most industries companies stockholders interest is
        aligned with providing good service to its customers in insurance industry it is not allways a case. Profit of insurance company
        comes charging premiums higher the payouts. Therefore profitability of its business strictly depends on how many claim it will be
        able to reject and how big premiums it will be able to market as fair. <b> And that is great space for mutuals, </b>mutuals works differently
        they are co-owned by their customers. Therefore there is no customer-owner conflict. That extraordinary. It is hard to bring another
        such example in economics.
      </p>
      <p> But it is not all that perfect. Because usually average (measured by amount of shares) mutuals owner is less aware of its rights than
        average stock owner manager-owner conflict kicks in. Information assymetry beetwen managers and mutuals owners usuall makes problem even worse.
        Thats <b>perfect case for blockchain</b> with natural <b>transparency</b> and <b>immutability</b>
        of blockchain Fellows Network can build tools helping mutuals owners to supervisor managers. With <b>automated execution</b> can easily
        build <b>votings</b> and <b>veto</b> functionality.</p>
